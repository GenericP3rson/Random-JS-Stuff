Rules::
1) No two number in the same row.
2) No two numbers in the same column.
3) No two numbers in the same box(3x3).
Is the third one always true if the first two are? Okay. There's a codewars?????? Wow. Mind blown. Again.
I'm sacrificing so many minds to you today.
No, not always. I've done the first two rules before but not the third one on codewars and there were a few sequence which didn't work.
Yes. &#9786;
So, a for loop inside a for loop. Yeah.

I don't like grey anymore.
What's a social network?
Basically a database with a bunch of profiles. Like Facebook. Should I be worried?
Geez, I wonder why. &#9786 Well, it's not exactly secure.... It pretty much will-Actually, I won't tell you its weakness. Oops
Well, Khan Academy tells you how to, so probably not? I think it's only the action of hacking that's considered illegal.
Yeah, I think it's actually considered a real job, to check whether websites are secure. That's cool!
By the way, did you know this(Atom) was created using Electron???? That would be cool! Well, kind of.... It's acually not that hard:
//To convert a JS string to acual code:
var str = "console.log('Hey there!')";
//Okay, I can't remember the secure way to do this, but here's the unsecure version:
eval(str);





Oh! It's that eval thing again!
Yup. It works really well, but it's not considered good practice because someone could easily inject evil JS in there.

Exactly what I was doing. When I wanted to hack something. I was pretty much injecting evil code? into it to display

It was in Php. I had it display things.

So, since it would read whatever my command was as a string

'Whatever_you_search'

You can enter a ' to mess it up. That or you can enter code.
So, they were doing something similar with HTML (for getting the credit card numbers).

This awesome British guy. His name is Dr. Mike Pound, I think. He's the best!

Anyways, in Php, the comment is a --
So, he wrote windows';[CODE HERE]--

For the HTML thing, he started with a simple alert. Then he went insane, getting the hash passwords, then  running
them through something meant for deep learning, but using instead for hashcat, and pretty much decrypted about
80-90% of the passwords.

The decrypting thing is the best! There's this awesome hacker who created a bunch of rules and, as people
get, like, password leaks, there is more and more data to have potential password dictionaries. Dr. Pound
called it scary. I call it awesome. I felt like Palpatine again.

Um... how are you? I think I'm a little insane at the moment. How was that French test? Nice

Nice. You should be fine. He's an easy grader.
Same. Well... the French are weird spellers. Nicolas and I were having a massive discussion on how weird the French are.
Anyways, do you want to code something?

That might confuse them. And, Git isn't too hard to learn, so it might not be necessary.
We can ask the class what they want?


Woah. &#9786; Fine, what about you? Perhaps. Well, we got the written part, and I got an 100, so hopefully I did well on the
oral part? I accidently said "je parle d'anglais et un petit petit petit peu d'anglais" But then I corrected myself, so I think I'm ok.
Yeah, mostly the only points I've gotten off are spelling errors, but he only takes off 0.25 points or something.
True. Sure, though I was thinking.... What if we got everyone started on a massive project together, so they could learn all the Git
Commands and how to write to a repository? I beg to differ. Git might be easy, but it's super important in the long run.
Yeah, we can explain all the terms and stuff to them on Thursday and we can see what they want.

We'll give them a git account when they get their codewars account and codepen account, etc.

Go ahead and continue to type.

Okay, then, on a very random note, I found this awesome site that trains coder for competitions.
Do you
No... what's that?


That sounds fantastic. No, this is for... do you knwo that CS Olympiad? Well, it's a training place for that.
It's sort of like IMO. If you do well in the training, you can get asked to a course to train you up for
the, like, International US team. Anyways. I haven't started it yet. Would you like the link?

http://train.usaco.org/ this is it, I think.
Um... on another note, Code-in starts on Tuesday. I'm not sure if you said yes or no.
Anyways, what do you want to code?

I forgot what I was going to say. Is it Geek-something??? It's something I saw which has
A list of some possible whiteboard questions for interviews and stuff. Yes?
Woah. That's really cool! Sure! It sounds really cool.
? I was hoping you had an idea...

Have you started on science fair yet? It was due on Friday? When is it due for you?
If you want, I can do a proof check for you, so you have less work and those evil spelling errors don't live?
Whenever you want. If you want. And the neural nets part? Then the genetic algorithms part?
Then the coding part? You're...
Okay. What are you going to do?
Okay. Um... you would like to see what I've done so far on my science fair. (It's just opening the user's image on python and taking user's input.) Question.
Did you magically see it again?


Don't we need to finish the background paper first? Oh, Mrs. Darr gave us an extension. Tomorrow. Well, that could be difficult considering I haven't actually
Finished it yet......... Now? Well, I haven't finished the flu paper yet, but I'm hoping to by 7:00ish? I'm not planning on using neural networks... or genetic
Algorithms. Well, I'm mostly just researching all the possible environmental/physical factors which could influence my experiment. I might consider changing the
idea slightly because it doesn't use a lot of innovative coding ideas. Not sure yet.... Sure? Is this a question or a demand? Sure! No....
Um... this is not working, then?
No.... Should I create a copy of it?

Hmm... No. Was there something you did differently? Is this in the same folder as package.json? I don't know. It's not a big deal. Anyways, what would you like to code?
Who?!?! Interesting...

What do you wish to code? I think we've been at this question for a while.... Ooh, I made a broke a sudoku solver.
Would you like to create an actual one?

Go to the top. We'll made a function.
Sure!

? What sort of evil code? while(true)?
Yes, oops, continue....
Oh yeah, have you ever created your own compiler before? Really? It's on my things-to-code list.

Wow! That's so cool! We should create our own text editor!


Oh! That's so cool. I was looking into how to hack those sorts of things.
Well... I wanted to create a Php thing so I can hack ('cause, for some reason it's illegal in the UK).
I don't know? I mean, I'd only be able to steal passwords and credit card numbers....

Hey, if you finish your social network, can I hack it? (Or try to?) Exactly.
All the more the challenge? Hey, do you think it's illegal to teach our coding club members how to hack?
Well... it's not illegal if you have permission, right?
Oh yeah, I heard about that. Mrs. Antuna's husband does something with coding and security. I don't know what, though.

/*
Are you around?
How'd you do that?
Can you still go to the last file?
Then it works! Nothing. I was reading your message. Then I switched to this tab.
 Woah! No idea! I was just typing and then I was brought over to this file!
 Yes What did you do? Cool
 Though can you now work on a file without me being automatically transported over there???
 No, I can go to the JSON one, I just did. But can you go to the JSON one?
 Yay! I'm still here! Alright, what would you like to do?
 Well, I was working on a social network, but I got bored on the UI portion and gave up.



I don't know. I haven't thought this far. What's your coding interests as of now?


Huzzah! It just wrote "edit edit edit" over there, so it works.

Try it? I'll stay here. You go to the JSON.Okay, I'll try

Space.
